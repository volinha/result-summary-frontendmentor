## Overview

A simple challenge to create a results summary page with different designs in mobile/desktop resolutions.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles

### What I learned

Since this code is fairly simple, just letting a snippet about how is possible to manage the breakpoints using TailwindCSS:

```jsx
function App() {

  const [myData, setMyData] = useState(data);

  return (
    <div className="sm:h-screen flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center font-sans text-[18px] bg-white">
      <div className="sm:flex sm:shadow-2xl sm:rounded-xl">
        <FinalResult rawData={myData}/>
        <Summary rawData={myData}/>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
Each component is a container and its shown differently if its on the `sm` breakpoint (`min-width: 640px`) or not. Since the shadows are only in the desktop version, both are constrained to the small breakpoints in a separated `div`.

### Continued development

A good idea for continued development in this project is to simplify the summary component to generate the different topics based only in the JSON data.
